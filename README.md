This repository contains scripts and trained models for my Master of Data Science Research Project - Automated Butterfly Wings' Classifier using Machine Learning

FILES:

functions.py - contain user functions for feature extraction and plots
projectbutterfly_deepmodels.py - code for training deep models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
projectbutterfly_efficientnets.py - code for training efficientnetb0 on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
projectbutterfly_mobilenets.py - code for training mobilenetv1 and mobilenetv2 on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
manual-basic-aug.py - code for basic manual image transformations (e.g, flipping, noise introduction, etc.)
mobilenet-finetune.py - code for training model with finetuning
imagesorter.py - code for sorting images to either trained species or unidentifiable
FOLDER: results - contain trained models
