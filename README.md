2. projectbutterfly_deepmodels.py - code for training deep models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
3. projectbutterfly_efficientnets.py - code for training efficientnetb0 on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
4. projectbutterfly_mobilenets.py - code for training mobilenetv1 and mobilenetv2 on Leeds and Malaysia dataset
5. manual-basic-aug.py - code for basic manual image transformations (e.g, flipping, noise introduction, etc.)
6. mobilenet-finetune.py - code for training model with finetuning
7. imagesorter.py - code for sorting images to either trained species or unidentifiable
